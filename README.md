# GTA
Basic lane detection with need of parameter changes at different times in the image processing part.


Results with right values for the CV2 methods. With the used values I have tried to accomplish a detection at night and day.
Better results should get accomplished by using variables which are bound to the time or the brightness of the scene/sky.
